Cleave:
  text: >
    When you **cleave armored foes at close range**, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, you smash through their defenses and equipment; inflict 3-wear. On a 7-9, you overextend your weapon or yourself: mark wear or end up in a bad spot, your choice.

Confuse Senses:
  text: When you **throw something to confuse an opponent's senses at close or intimate range**, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you've thrown them off balance, blinded them, deafened them, or confused them, and given yourself an opportunity. On a 10+, they have to take some time to get their bearings and restore their senses before they can act clearly again. On a 7-9, you have just a few moments.

Disarm:
  text: When you target an opponent's weapon with your strikes at close range, roll with Finesse. On a hit, they have to mark 2-exhaustion or lose their weapon—it's well out of reach. On a 10+, they have to mark 3-exhaustion instead of 2.

Harry:
  text: >
    When you **harry a group of enemies at far range**, mark wear and roll with Cunning. On a 10+, both. On a 7-9, choose 1:


    * inflict 2-morale harm

    * they are pinned or blocked

Improvise Weapon:
  text: >
    When you **make a weapon out of improvised materials around you**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you make a weapon; the GM will tell you its range tag and at least one other tag based on the materials you used. On a 7-9, the weapon also has a weakness tag.

Parry:
  text: >
    When you **try to parry the attacks of an enemy at close range**, mark exhaustion and roll with Finesse. On a hit, you consume their attention. On a 10+, pick 3. On a 7-9, pick 1.


    * you inflict morale or exhaustion harm (GM's choice)

    * you disarm your opponent; their weapon is out of hand, but in reach

    * you don't suffer any harm

Quick Shot:

    * you don't mark wear

    * you don't mark exhaustion

    * you move quickly and change your position (and, if you choose, range)

    * you keep your target at bay—they don't move

Storm a Group:
  text: >
    When you storm a group of foes in melee, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, trade harm. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1.


    * you show them up; you inflict 2-morale harm

    * you keep them off balance and confused; you inflict 2-exhaustion

    * you avoid their blows to the best of your ability; you suffer little (-1) harm.

    * you use them against each other; mark exhaustion again and they inflict their harm against themselves

Trick Shot:
  text: >
    When you **fire a clever shot designed to take advantage of the environment**, mark wear and roll with Finesse. On a 7-9, choose 2. On a 10+, choose 3.


    * your shot lands in any target of your choice within range, even if it's behind cover or hidden (inflicting injury or wear if appropriate)

    * your shot strikes a second available target of your choice

    * your shot cuts something, breaks something, or knocks something over, your choice

    * your shot distracts an opponent and provides an opportunity

Vicious Strike:
  text: >
    When you **viciously strike an opponent where they are weak at intimate or close range**, mark exhaustion and roll with Might. On a hit, they suffer serious (+1) harm and cannot mark wear on their armor to block it. On a 10+, you get away with the strike. On a 7-9, they score a blow against you as well.
