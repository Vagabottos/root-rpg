  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **study your tomes and scrolls to discover old techniques or methods** to solve an intractable problem—curing a deadly disease, ending a drought, legally unseating a leader, etc—decide what you want to change and tell the GM. The GM will give you between 1 to 4 conditions you must fulfill to discover a path forward, including time taken, additional information needed, mentors or translators needed, facilities/tools needed, or the limits of your solution.

On a miss, your search yields terrible news—someone is acting against you or your interests in an unexpected arena.

Loremaster:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **consult your knowledge in order to understand a political conflict**, roll with Cunning. On a hit, the GM tells you what information you remember that completes your understanding of the messy situation. On a 10+, you can ask a followup question; the GM will answer honestly.

Good Advice:
  archetype: The Chronicler
  text: When you **offer an NPC advice about a sticky situation**, offer them the best advice you've got and roll with cunning.

    * If they merely know you by your former reputation, take a +1.

    * If you have worked closely with them before, take a +2.

    * If they were a close friend or loyal servitor, take a +3.


    On a hit, your exile has done little to diminish their respect for you; they offer you whatever comfort and aid they can, even to the point of risking their own reputation and safety. On a 7-9, they can only assist you if they can cover their tracks when you leave; mark as much notoriety with their faction as you added to your roll as they spread a story of the terrible treatment they endured when they met you.

On a miss, they mount a competing expedition based on what you have told them.

Watch the Signs:
  archetype: The Seeker
  text: >
    When you first attune yourself to a ruin or mysterious site by taking in its signs, symbols, particular traits, and layout, roll with Cunning. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2.

  archetype: The Ranger
  text: >
    You have expertise in the poisons and antidotes of the Woodland. When you brew a poison, mark depletion and say what effect you want it to have: sleep, weakness, inebriation, or death.
